### **Project Name : Note Sharing Web Application**

**Idea By: Kamrul Hasan**

Our project is a **Note Sharing Web Application** designed to help students easily share and access academic resources.

In this platform, a user will first **sign up** by providing basic information such as **name, roll number, roll ID, section, department, batch, blood group**, and an **optional phone number**.

After registration, the user can **sign in** using their **roll ID and batch number**.

An **authenticated user** can manage their profile by **adding, updating, or deleting** their **profile picture**. Users can also **view the list of students** from their **previous and next batches**, including **names and roll numbers**. By clicking on any name, they can view that student’s **detailed profile**.

Additionally, users can **filter the student list by batch** and **access academic resources** such as notes or study materials. They can choose to view either **resources for their current semester** or **all available resources**.

### **Future Features**

In future updates, users will be able to **post help requests** to seek or offer assistance to others within the platform.
