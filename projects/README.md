# UniSoft Tech Squad 23 - Projects

This directory holds the main software engineering projects developed by the team. Each project should have its own subdirectory, which includes the source code, documentation, and any other related files.

Our goal is to follow the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for each project, from requirement analysis to deployment.
